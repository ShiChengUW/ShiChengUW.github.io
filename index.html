      <h2 style="color:darkblue;">  About me </h2>
      <p>   I did my PhD study from 2019 to 2022 in <i style="color:blue;"> University of Warsaw </i>
         under the supervision of <a href="http://psulkows.fuw.edu.pl" target="_blank">Piotr Sułkowski</a>. I 
	      initiated research skills from 2016 to 2019 in UESTC by collaborating with Sung-Soo Kim.
	      I was a postdoc in <i style="color:blue;"> Fudan University </i> 
         in the group of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snawata" target="_blank">Satoshi Nawata</a>. 
         </p>
	   <p>  Recently, I move to <a href="https://www.simis.cn/" target="_blank">SIMIS</a> as a junior faculty.  </p>

<h2 style="color:darkblue;">  Research interests </h2>
  <p> I am mainly focusing on physical and geometric aspects of 3d gauge theories, including:</p>
<ul>
<li> 3d gauge theories and dualities  </li>
  <li> Three-manifolds and invariants  </li>
  <li> 3d TFT and MTC  </li>
</ul>

This project is straightforward and can be done quickly once it is noticed that the handle silding is also preserved even in the presence of matters, although I did not finish it quickly. I did a lot of usefuless work on trying to naively integrating out the gauge group that is attached with matter fields, which wasted me much time. I also wasted much time on trying to interprete the superpotential triangles as the handle slides of surgery circles, which turns out to be wrong and fusion looks the right candidate for superpotentials. I also underestimated the power of vortex partition functions such that this project did not start early. Anyway, the result looks fine for me at least this moment, as it can be a sign that surgery can obtain the result in DGG's construction, and is much more easy to analyze.

This project is difficult to me, as I often feel having no tool to address the problem. Although the computation is little, the amout of  
thinking is a lot. Finally, it looks that the result opens a door to a colorful garden, in which I can see some familiar trees and flowers (MTC, category, higher form symmetries) are already there waiting for me.

	 <p> Aug-02-2023, <i>3d N=2 theories and plumbing graphs: adding matter, gauging, and new dualities</i>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13371" target="_blank"> arXiv:2302.13371</a> was accepted by JHEP.  </p>

	This paper studies the dualities of abelian theories. We proposed a new quiver diagram --- plumbing graphs with matter nodes. We notice that the bifundamental 
	  matter is a bit subtle. After a few weeks of trying to break the barrier of understanding and to derive superpotential triangles, everything is smoothly and quickly done. 
	  The brane web is also a bit subtle. After this work, I can clearly see that there should be a closed relation between 3d theories and operations on three-manifolds.
