  <h1 style="color:darkblue;"> My father's work </h1>

   <p>
	  In this year, namely 2022, my father found some tricks on making braids, which he thinks are very useful in practice, in particular for firemen.
	  </p>
      

	  
     
 <h2 style="color:darkblue;">  A braid for connecting two strings </h2>
	  <p>  The following is a braid that can be instantly tight if one pulls the two ends (B and D) of these two strings denoted by AB and CD.  </p>
     <p> 一个可以快速拉紧的节： </p>
<p> My comment：this braid is similar to a typical way of braids for shoes, while this braid has the advantage that it can be tight instantly can not easy to losse. </p>

 <h2 style="color:darkblue;">  A braid that can be tightened and loosend easily </h2>
	  
	  <p>  The follwoing is a braid that can be used to various circumstances, accoding to my father. There are some properties for this braid. For instance,
		  it can be completely loosed to a straight line by pulling some ends (A and F) of the rope. However, if pulling one other part (E), the rope becomes tight.
		  </p>
	  <p>
	  The string can be very tight between two trees, so it can be used to save people during a flood. This braid can also be used to tie legs of cattles, so my father call it 
		  捆牛绳 or an overvalued long name "三位一体两松一固的锁扣". One can also pull up oneself when climbing a cliff. These applications are expectations and have passted any test, so I cannot be sure if the braid really works or safe.
	  </p>
	  
     <p>  
	  There are three steps to make this braid. I draw it below. There are some loops which are designed to loose tangles and increase friction of the braid. 
	  Definitely, not all tangles are good or efficient, so the art of making braids is playing with these tangles and their combinations.
